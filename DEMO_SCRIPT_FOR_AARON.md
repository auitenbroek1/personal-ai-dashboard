cd dashboard/frontend
npm run dev

# Verify both are running:
# ✅ Backend: http://localhost:3001
# ✅ Frontend: http://localhost:5173
```

### 2. Verify System Status
```bash
# Quick system check
curl http://localhost:3001/health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/dashboard/overview
```

## Demo Flow (15-20 minutes)

   - Explain: "Built for extensibility and maintenance"

### Act 5: Business Value (3 minutes)
**"Here's what this means for your business..."**

1. **Real-Time Monitoring:**
   - "Immediate visibility into AI agent performance"
   - "Proactive issue detection and resolution"

2. **System Integration:**
   - "Leverages existing infrastructure investments"
   - "No disruption to current workflows"

3. **Professional Interface:**
   - "Client-ready dashboard for demonstrations"
   - "Modern, intuitive user experience"

4. **Automation Enhancement:**
   - "Centralizes control of multiple AI systems"
   - "Streamlines complex automation workflows"

## Demo Talking Points

### Opening Hook
*"Imagine having a mission control center for all your AI assistants - where you can see everything happening in real-time, just like NASA monitors space missions."*

### Technical Credibility
- "100% integration test passing rate"
- "Real-time WebSocket communication"
- "Production-ready architecture"
- "Seamless existing system integration"

### Business Benefits
- **Visibility:** "See exactly what your AI agents are doing"
- **Control:** "Manage and coordinate multiple automation systems"
- **Integration:** "Works with your existing tools and processes"
- **Scalability:** "Grows with your automation needs"

### Client Engagement Questions
1. "What automation challenges are you currently facing?"
2. "How do you currently monitor your AI systems?"
3. "What would real-time visibility mean for your operations?"
4. "How important is integration with existing systems?"

## Troubleshooting (Just in Case)

### If WebSocket isn't connecting:
```bash
# Restart backend
cd dashboard/backend
node src/simple-server.js
```

### If frontend won't load:
```bash
# Clear cache and restart
cd dashboard/frontend
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```

### If APIs return 404:
- Make sure you're using the simple-server.js (not index.ts)
- Verify port 3001 is available

## Post-Demo Follow-up

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **"Would you like me to set this up for your specific use case?"**
2. **"I can customize the dashboard for your particular automation needs"**
3. **"We can integrate with your existing systems within 2-3 weeks"**

### Technical Discussion
- Show the test report: `SPARC_INTEGRATION_TEST_REPORT.md`
- Discuss specific integration requirements
- Outline implementation timeline

### Business Proposal
- Custom dashboard development: 2-4 weeks
- Integration with existing systems: 1-2 weeks  
- Training and documentation: 1 week
- Ongoing support and enhancements
