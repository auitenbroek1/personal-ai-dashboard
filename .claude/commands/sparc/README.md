# SPARC Framework Documentation

## Overview

The SPARC (Specialized Parallel Agent Resource Coordination) framework provides a comprehensive suite of 17 specialized AI agent modes designed for collaborative software development and project management. Each mode represents a distinct expertise area with specific tools, responsibilities, and coordination patterns.

## Architecture

### Core Principles
- **Specialization**: Each mode focuses on specific domain expertise
- **Coordination**: Modes work together through shared tools and protocols
- **Efficiency**: Batch operations and parallel execution for optimal performance
- **Memory**: Persistent knowledge sharing across sessions and modes
- **Scalability**: Support for complex, multi-agent workflows

### Communication Patterns
- **TodoWrite/TodoRead**: Task coordination and progress tracking
- **Memory**: Shared knowledge and state management
- **Task**: Agent spawning and inter-mode communication
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient file and data processing

## Usage Patterns

### Single Mode Execution
```bash
# Run specific mode for targeted tasks
./claude-flow sparc run coder "Build REST API with authentication"
./claude-flow sparc run researcher "Analyze AI market trends" --parallel
./claude-flow sparc run architect "Design microservices architecture"
```

### Multi-Mode Coordination
```bash
# Orchestrated development workflow
./claude-flow sparc run orchestrator "Full-stack application development" \
  --agents coder,tester,reviewer,documenter \
  --parallel --monitor
```

### Specialized Workflows
```bash
# Test-driven development workflow
./claude-flow sparc tdd "User authentication system" --coverage 90

# Performance optimization workflow
./claude-flow sparc run optimizer "Database query optimization" \
  --baseline --metrics --report
```

## Best Practices

### Mode Selection
1. **Start with Orchestrator**: For complex, multi-faceted projects
2. **Use Specialists**: For focused, domain-specific tasks
3. **Combine Complementary**: Pair modes that enhance each other (coder + tester)
4. **Scale Gradually**: Begin simple, add complexity as needed

### Coordination Strategies
1. **Shared Memory**: Use for persistent state and knowledge sharing
2. **Todo Management**: Coordinate tasks and track progress
3. **Batch Operations**: Optimize file operations and processing
4. **Parallel Execution**: Leverage concurrent processing capabilities

### Quality Assurance
1. **Always Include Testing**: Combine development modes with tester
2. **Code Review**: Use reviewer mode for quality validation
3. **Documentation**: Include documenter for comprehensive coverage
4. **Continuous Optimization**: Regular optimizer runs for performance

## Integration Workflows

### Software Development Lifecycle
1. **Planning**: architect â†’ orchestrator â†’ workflow-manager
2. **Development**: coder â†’ tdd â†’ reviewer
3. **Testing**: tester â†’ debugger â†’ optimizer
4. **Documentation**: documenter â†’ designer (for visual docs)
5. **Deployment**: batch-executor â†’ memory-manager (for knowledge capture)

### Research and Innovation
1. **Discovery**: researcher â†’ innovator â†’ analyzer
2. **Analysis**: analyzer â†’ memory-manager â†’ documenter
3. **Implementation**: architect â†’ coder â†’ tester
4. **Optimization**: optimizer â†’ reviewer â†’ documenter

### Maintenance and Support
1. **Issue Analysis**: debugger â†’ analyzer â†’ memory-manager
2. **Resolution**: coder â†’ tester â†’ reviewer
3. **Documentation**: documenter â†’ memory-manager
4. **Process Improvement**: workflow-manager â†’ optimizer

## Configuration and Customization

### Mode Customization
Each mode can be customized through:
- Tool selection and permissions
- Memory key assignments
- Timeout and performance settings
- Parallel execution parameters
- Monitoring and logging levels

### Workflow Templates
Pre-configured workflow templates for common scenarios:
- **Full-Stack Development**: orchestrator + coder + tester + reviewer + documenter
- **API Development**: architect + coder + tester + documenter
- **Performance Optimization**: analyzer + optimizer + tester + documenter
- **Research Project**: researcher + analyzer + memory-manager + documenter

## Monitoring and Optimization

### Performance Metrics
- Mode execution time and efficiency
- Resource utilization and bottlenecks
- Coordination overhead and communication
- Memory usage and knowledge sharing effectiveness
- Overall workflow productivity and quality

### Continuous Improvement
- Regular performance analysis and optimization
- Mode effectiveness assessment
- Workflow pattern refinement
- Tool usage optimization
- Knowledge base enhancement

## Getting Started

### Quick Start
```bash
# Initialize SPARC environment (already done)
./claude-flow sparc modes

# Run your first SPARC workflow
./claude-flow sparc run coder "Create a simple web server"

# Try multi-mode coordination
./claude-flow sparc run orchestrator "Build a todo app" \
  --agents coder,tester,documenter
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Custom workflow with specific coordination
./claude-flow sparc run workflow-manager "CI/CD pipeline setup" \
  --memory-key cicd_patterns \
  --parallel --monitor --timeout 120

# Research and development workflow
./claude-flow sparc run swarm-coordinator "AI integration research" \
  --agents researcher,innovator,analyzer,documenter \
  --max-agents 8 --parallel
```
